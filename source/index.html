                <p><strong>What is Monthly Mix?</strong> Playlists of the latest music from each month, with a new playlist going up on the 1st(ish) of each&nbsp;month</p>
                <p><strong>What music will be featured?</strong> Anything released from the last month, either tracks from albums or individual tracks. Genre wise anything goes. Realistically it will just be the same indie or underground assortment you find on the internet.</p>
