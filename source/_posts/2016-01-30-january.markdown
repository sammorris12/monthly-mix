Hey Monthly Mixers

By this point you’re probably bored with lists of music, but that’s kind of this site’s jam, so here’s a list of music. Unlike those end of year lists, this one will only make you feel bad about the past month’s music.

December is normally a quiet month, but a fair few heavy hitters came out to increase anticipation for 2016. We’ve got new tracks by Thee Oh Sees, Anderson Paak, Shad, Peter, Bjorn and John, and more.

For those who want more lists, I’ve filled in the blanks in the 2015 archive. Playlists for January through to May are now available for those who can’t remember those heady times.

Give me a shout if you like this month’s playlist or if there are any glaring omissions. You can reply to this email or give me a tweet.

Happy New Year Month,
Sam Morris
