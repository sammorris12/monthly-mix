Hey Monthly Mixers

Another new year, but more importantly another new month, which means it’s time for the first Monthly Mix of the year. January always tends to deliver and 2016’s jams from Jan are no exception. January gave us brand new tracks by Kanye West, RJD2, Field Music, Yeasayer, Frankie Cosmos, and much more.

Give me a shout if you like this month’s playlist or if there are any glaring omissions. You can reply to this email or give me a tweet.

Happy New Month,
Sam Morris
