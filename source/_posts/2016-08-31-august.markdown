Young Thug is now Jeffery. Viet Cong are now Preoccupations. King Krule is now Return of the Pimp Shrimp. Thankfully, Monthly Mix will always be Monthly Mix. Reliable in name if nothing else&#8482;. I'm working on a catcher slogan, but until that happens here's the Monthly Mix for August. It's got new tracks from Thundercat, Ultimate Painting and Sampha. 

Is there anything you think I've missed from the past month?

Let me know on the Twitter.
