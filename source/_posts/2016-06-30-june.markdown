While most of the heavy-hitters are in transit between festivals they tend not releasing tracks. Explaining why June, for some, might feature a more unfamiliar cast of seventeen artists than a previous months. That's not to say this playlist has been a challenge to put together. In fact new emerging artists like Hoops, Buneo, Terry and more make up one of Monthly Mix's most eclectic and exciting playlists yet. Leaving you wonder why you didn't know about these artists before.

Is there anything you think I've missed from the past month? And while we're on the subject, what artists do you like who don't get the credit they're due?

Let me know on the Twitter.
