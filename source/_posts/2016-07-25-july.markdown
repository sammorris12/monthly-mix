It might seem like **everything** is a hot mess right now, but music doesn’t care. Surprisingly the Monthly Mix for July is laid-back and on the beach. Even the list of artists sound like fairly chill people to hang out with. Like Mild High Club, Holydrug Couple, River Tiber. Who wouldn’t want to hang out with them?

Is there anything you think I've missed from the past month?

Let me know on the Twitter.
